### Hi there 👋, My name is Vipeen Kumar. Welcome to my Github. 
I am a **research scholar** at Panjab University, Chandiarh. 
### About my github resources
I have uploaded some of my projects that i have implemented and learnt during my Ph.D. Here you will get latex, python and r files with their applications in econometrics, finance and machine learning. I have also added some courses in economics, statistics, finance and machine learning. Do checkout them also. 
### Here's my brief profile.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on Exchange Rates.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning various skills like Python, R and Machine learning
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on research on econometric and financial models.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with resources in the above fields and will surely look into that.
- 💬 Ask me about anything about the above field, I will give my best.

| :-----        |    :----:   |  ----:  |
| <a href='https://www.weijiechen.com/tutorials/linear-algebra-with-python-book/linear-algebra-index'>Linear Algebra with Python</a>      | This training will walk you through all the must-know concepts that set the foundation of data science or advanced quantitative skill sets. Suitable for statisticians, econometricians, quantitative analysts, data scientists, etc. to quickly refresh linear algebra with the assistance of Python computation and visualization. Core concepts covered are: <b>linear combination</b>,  <b>vector space,  <b>linear transformation</b>,  <b>eigenvalues</b> and <b>-vector</b>,  <b>diagnolization</b>,  <b>singular value decomposition</b>, etc.      | [link](https://github.com/weijie-chen/tutorial/Linear-Algebra-With-Python) |
| <a href='https://github.com/weijie-chen/Basic-Statistics-With-Python'>Basic Statistics with Python</a>   | These notes aim to refresh the essential concepts of frequentist statistics, such as <b>descriptive statistics</b>, <b>parameter estimations</b>, <b>hypothesis testing</b>, <b>ANOVA</b> and etc. All codes are straightforward to understand. We were spending roughly three hours in total to cover all sections. | [link](https://github.com/weijie-chen/Basic-Statistics-With-Python) |
| <a href='https://www.weijiechen.com/tutorials/econometrics-book/econometrics-index'>Econometrics with Python</a>  | This is a crash course for reviewing the most important concepts and techniques of econometrics. The theories are presented lightly without hustles of mathematical derivation and Python codes are mostly procedural and straightforward. Core concepts covered: single and multi-<b>linear regression</b>,  <b>logistic model</b>,  <b>dummy variable</b>,  <b>simultaneous equations model</b>,  <b>panel data model</b> and  <b>time series analysis</b>.   | [link](https://github.com/weijie-chen/Econometrics-With-Python) |
| <a href='https://www.weijiechen.com/tutorials/financial-engineering-book/financial-engineering-index'>Financial Engineering</a> |  This is a compound training sessions of time series analysis, financial engineering and algorithmic trading. The Part I covers the basics of sell-side financial engineering such <b>stochastic processes</b>, <b>partial differential equations</b>, <b>Black-Scholes model</b>, <b>mixed jump-diffusion model</b>, and etc. The Part II will cover the buy-side financial engineering such <b>portfolio-optimization</b>, <b>multi-factor modeling</b>, <b>Black-Litterman model</b>, etc.    | [link](https://github.com/weijie-chen/Time-Series-and-Financial-Engineering-With-Python)|
| <a href='https://www.weijiechen.com/tutorials/bayesian-statistics-book/bayesian-index'>Bayesian Statistics with Python</a>  | Bayesian statistics is the last pillar of quantitative framework, also the most challenging subject. The course will explore the algorithms of <b>Markov chain Monte Carlo</b> (MCMC), specifically <b>Metropolis-Hastings</b>, <b>Gibbs Sampler</b> and etc., we will build up our own toy model from crude Python functions. In the meanwhile, we will cover the PyMC3, which is a library for probabilistic programming specializing in Bayesian statistics.| [link](https://github.com/weijie-chen/Bayesian-Statistics-Econometrics)|
